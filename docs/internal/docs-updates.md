# How To Request Updates to Documentation

## General Request Process

HBCD Consortium members can request updates to either the internal or public Docs sites by submitting a ticket to the [Lasso Help Center](https://nbdc-datashare.lassoinformatics.com/help-center) (select the "Documentation" category when submitting a ticket). The sites include:

- [HBCD DCC Docs](../index.md): internal documentation site (*this site*)
- [HBCD Data Release Docs](https://docs.hbcdstudy.org/): public data release documentation 

Requested updates to the content may include (but is not limited to) addition of information/pages (particularly welcome for the internal Docs site), updates to existing content, removal of outdated information, etc.


## Study Instrument Pages

Each study instrument/measure has a dedicated page on the public Docs site - see all instruments included in the release by expanding domain sections under [Study Instruments](https://docs.hbcdstudy.org/latest/instruments/#instruments-by-domain). Individual pages can be reached by clicking on the instrument name in the tables.
