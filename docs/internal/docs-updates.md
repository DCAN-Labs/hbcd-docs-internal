# How To Request Updates to Documentation

## General Request Process

HBCD Consortium members can request updates to either the internal or public Docs sites by submitting a ticket to the [Lasso Help Center](https://nbdc-datashare.lassoinformatics.com/help-center) (select the "Documentation" category when submitting a ticket). The sites include:

- [HBCD DCC Docs](../index.md): internal documentation site (*this site*)
- [HBCD Data Release Docs](https://docs.hbcdstudy.org/): public data release documentation 

Requested updates to the content may include (but is not limited to) addition of information/pages (particularly welcome for the internal Docs site), updates to existing content, removal of outdated information, etc.


## Study Instrument Pages

Each study instrument/measure has a dedicated page on the public Docs site - see all instruments included in the release by expanding domain sections under [Study Instruments](https://docs.hbcdstudy.org/latest/instruments/#instruments-by-domain). Individual pages can be reached by clicking on the instrument name in the tables. Updates to existing pages or new page content can be provided in the following ways:

<table class="table-no-vertical-lines">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Updates To Existing Instrument Pages</td>
        <td style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: normal;">Please add updated text to this <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Bbyr4kwqwM91AGKwi1_Im31e-mkZd1s6wWfCsHMMrA/edit?usp=sharing>centralized collaborative document</a> by following the instructions in the first tab.</td>
