- Any feedback or feature requests to improve the ease and effectiveness of querying and analyzing data. 
- Any bugs that you may encounter in Lasso.
- Updates needed to the documentation on the [HBCD Data Release Docs](https://docs.hbcdstudy.org/latest/) website (*select "Documentation" under Category*).
