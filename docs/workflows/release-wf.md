## BR Hot Sheets

Every beta release (BR) of the HDCC data will have a corresponding "BR Hot Sheet" to be completed by the HDCC and sent to Lasso once all items are checked off. This document serves as a central resource for information regarding the release to address the following key areas:

- **Single Point of Truth on date/time**: provides a clear time/date when BRX is ready, and a single point of contact/truth 
- **Checklist/Information**: provides a checklist and information for Lasso and HDCC for when something may have changed that will either make the data sent â€˜non-compliantâ€™ (e.g.., not all participants represented in the `participant.tsv`) or break loading or downloading of files
- **Sign Off**: provides a clear/thoughtful sign off on what is going into a release and ensure it is properly documented on the internal Docs site
