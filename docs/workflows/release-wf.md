# Data Release Workflows & SOPs

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;">üöß <i>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</i> üöß </p>

This document outlines the staged workflow for selecting, releasing, and validating data for public dissemination. Key stakeholders include the HCAC Project Manager (PM), HBCD Data Coordinating Center (HDCC), Oversight Group (OG), Workgroups (WGs), and Lasso.

## Release Timeline

### Stage 1: Determine Measures to Include in Release

The HCAC PM (Stephanie Averill) collaborates with the HDCC to generate a comprehensive list of potential measures for the upcoming data release.

 - Leadership, the Oversight Group (OG), and Workgroups review and approve the proposed measures.
 - The full list is circulated to all Workgroups and subject matter experts (SMEs), who mark each variable as INCLUDE or NOT INCLUDED in the following form: [Measure Inclusion Form (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/171oj0PLLtVgp5OSReBD5J6Ir4U56QQrWEwu92ZwttrM/edit?usp=sharing)

### Stage 2: Integrate Planned Measures in Beta Releases

The HDCC implements the measures marked as INCLUDE and begins the first versioned Beta Release (BR) approximately 1‚Äì2 months after the data freeze. *Note: An updated SOP is under development to address scenarios where a measure is marked as ‚ÄúINCLUDE,‚Äù but cannot be implemented during the current release.*

#### Beta Release (BR) Sprint Cycle 

1. Known issues and new features are prioritized for the sprint.
2. Versioned BRs are released on the 4th Friday of every month.
3. Each BR is accompanied by a BR Hot Sheet completed by HDCC to guide Lasso ingestion - see [Hot Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwfD_lccV89u205KPdq_5dZCx_w4pu8BFWI31wLDH8Q/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Lasso Ingestion

Once the BR Hot Sheet is finalized, the HDCC sends it to Lasso to initiate BR ingestion, which includes [Lasso ingestion QA](qc.md#pre-release-pheno). After ingestion is complete, the HDCC liaison (Jen Zink) notifies WGs that data are available in Lasso and requests they complete Quality Control (QC) reviews.
  
### Stage 3: Data Quality Issue Identification, Reporting, and Handling  

There are 2 bins of issues with separate pipelines for reporting/handling:

##### Bin 1: Internal Findings

- Identified during [Lasso ingestion QA](qc.md#pre-release-pheno)
- Tracked by HDCC on the internal Monday board for resolution

##### Bin 2: Workgroup Findings

Issues identified by WGs, analysts, or via LORIS, reported in collaboration with the HDCC liaison (Jen Zink). These issues are logged in a structured format for BR sprint planning and resolution by HDCC. Once Bin 2 issues are added to an upcoming BR sprint and the corrections appear in a versioned BR in Lasso, Jen communicates to original reporter that the known issue is addressed and verifies the correction is implemented as expected in the Lasso system.
