# Data Release Workflows & SOPs

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;">üöß <i>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</i> üöß </p>

This document outlines the staged workflow for selecting, releasing, and validating data for public dissemination. Key stakeholders include the HCAC Project Manager (PM), HBCD Data Coordinating Center (HDCC), Oversight Group (OG), Workgroups (WGs), and Lasso.

## Stages of the Release Workflow

### Stage 1: Determine Measures to Include in Release

The HCAC PM (Stephanie Averill) collaborates with the HDCC to generate a comprehensive list of potential measures for the upcoming data release.

 - Leadership, the Oversight Group (OG), and Workgroups review and approve the proposed measures.
 - The full list is circulated to all Workgroups and subject matter experts (SMEs), who mark each variable as INCLUDE or NOT INCLUDED in the following form: [Measure Inclusion Form (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/171oj0PLLtVgp5OSReBD5J6Ir4U56QQrWEwu92ZwttrM/edit?usp=sharing)

### Stage 2: Integrate Planned Measures in Beta Releases

The HDCC implements the measures marked as INCLUDE and begins the first versioned Beta Release (BR) approximately 1‚Äì2 months after the data freeze. *Note: An updated SOP is under development to address scenarios where a measure is marked as ‚ÄúINCLUDE,‚Äù but cannot be implemented during the current release.*

#### Beta Release (BR) Sprint Cycle 

1. Known issues and new features are prioritized for the sprint.
2. Versioned BRs are released on the 4th Friday of every month.
3. Each BR is accompanied by a BR Hot Sheet completed by HDCC to guide Lasso ingestion - see [Hot Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwfD_lccV89u205KPdq_5dZCx_w4pu8BFWI31wLDH8Q/edit?usp=sharing).

</tr>

</table>

#### Lasso Ingestion

Once the BR Hot Sheet is finalized, the HDCC sends it to Lasso to initiate BR ingestion, which includes [Lasso ingestion QA](qc.md#pre-release-pheno). After ingestion is complete, the HDCC liaison (Jen Zink) notifies WGs that data are available in Lasso and requests they complete Quality Control (QC) reviews.
  
### Stage 3: Data Quality Issue Identification, Reporting, and Handling  

There are 2 bins of issues with separate pipelines for reporting/handling:

##### Bin 1: Internal Findings

- Identified during [Lasso ingestion QA](qc.md#pre-release-pheno)
- Tracked by HDCC on the internal Monday board for resolution

##### Bin 2: Workgroup Findings

Issues identified by WGs, analysts, or via LORIS, reported in collaboration with the HDCC liaison (Jen Zink). These issues are logged in a structured format for BR sprint planning and resolution by HDCC. Once Bin 2 issues are added to an upcoming BR sprint and the corrections appear in a versioned BR in Lasso, Jen communicates to original reporter that the known issue is addressed and verifies the correction is implemented as expected in the Lasso system.

**WG Template for reporting issues:**

> **Issue Category:** *Data Error, Data Improvement, Data Dictionary Request*       
**Data Element/Instrument Affected:** *Element/instrument name*          
**Description:** *Explanation of issue*         
**Explanation for how to address the issue**: *Description of fix*	      
**Reporter**: *SME/analyst name and contact information* 	

### Stage 4: Data Sign-off and Public Release

When the the second-to-last BR prior to Public Release is loaded in Lasso, the HDCC liaison (Jen Zink) schedules one-on-one sign-off meetings with all WG chairs/SMEs who have measures in the planned release for final QC/review in Lasso. Prior to these meetings, WG chairs/SMEs have pre-QC‚Äôed their data in the latest BR. During these meetings, Jen reviews:

1. Past QC items that have been identified and corrected in previous BRs
2. Any further QC action-items to be addressed prior to public release (if applicable) based on WG/SME review of the latest BR and items identified by Jen 

During the one-on-one sign-off meetings, if no further action-items are found by either the WG/SMEs or Jen, the WGs/SMEs sign off on their measures via this [sign-off sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zPfNGb7ejFlVelfGWNJZSlaslsv3yHQjjiZJgt0BiyU/edit?gid=615569410#gid=615569410). 

If further QC action-items are found in the second-to-last BR during the one-on-one sign-off meetings, the WG/SMEs do NOT sign off on their measures.  Jen communicates the data issues back to the HDCC via the centralized Monday Board, so the remaining items can be prioritized for the final BR prior to public release. 

When the final BR prior to public release is loaded into Lasso, Jen schedules one-on-one sign-off meetings with the remaining WGs/SMEs who were awaiting corrections to their data prior to sign off. During these meetings, Jen reviews the list of items that were identified in the last round of QC with the WGs/SMEs to ensure the correction is implemented as expected in the Lasso; the WGs/SMEs then sign off on their measures via the same google form above. 

In the event that data issues remain, or new issues are identified in QC of the final BR during the one-on-one sign-off meetings, Jen collaborates with the WGs/SMEs and Luci Moore to document these as ‚ÄòKnown Issues‚Äô for the Data Release Documentation site. Jen reports the known issues on the HDCC centralized Monday Board so they can be prioritized for the Patch Release.
