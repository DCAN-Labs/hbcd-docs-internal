### ⚠️ Duplicate Options for 'Mother Ethnicity' Variable

The variable 'Mother Ethnicity' (`sed_basic_demographics_screen_mother_race`) has duplicate options for the selection of 'Black African American' (option #3). This option is not used for data entry, and instead the 'Black_or African American' option (option #5) should be used. No other variables are affected by this.
