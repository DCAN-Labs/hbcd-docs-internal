## Known Issues
### ⚠️ #1 - Missing Labels For Multi-Select Fields (Impacting Several Instruments)
This is due to an adjustment done to multi-select fields, whereby fields with multi-select options are converted into separate columns/fields as 'checkboxes'. In these cases, the 'Description' metadata has been mistakenly overwritten with the expected value (TRUE/FALSE), and this has also duplicated the number of fields in the metadata by providing one entry for each option of the resulting checkbox. As a result, Lasso has not loaded the data yet into their systems. We are aware of this issue and it should be resolved for the upcoming BR14.6.

### ⚠️ #2 - `pex_bm_health_preg` Leaked HTML Code
The field `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__02` has HTML leak text in the output: `<span style="color:#888;">[<span style="margin:0 2px;">No results were returned</span>]</span>`. This has been resolved for BR14.6.

### ⚠️ #3 - `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__01` Entries Mistakenly Replaced With GUID (Bug In De-Identitification Worfklow)
The field `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__01` has 3 entries that start with sub-XXXXXX. These have text entered instead of medication codes. Per Santiago, these entries are the GUID used to de-identify the data. This is due to the de-identification process, which recognizes the code for the medication as if it were a 'candID' and replaces it with the GUID (in this case the following codes were replaced with the corresponding GUID: 211965, 372596, 998033). 

Harshitha will need to modify the de-identification process to run solely on the 'candID' column and not on the data, as 6 digit numbers may be mistaken for IDs and replaced with GUIDs.

In addition, 5 entries that were incorrectly entered as strings instead of codes for this field were caught and replaced.
