## Known Issues Resolved
### ⚠️ #1 - Incorrect Data: Height/Weight/Head Circumference (`ph_ch_anthro`)
Though the grand majority of Z-scores are within the range of -3 to 3, there appear to be several cases where there are values entered that are out of the established range as per the current validations (implemented on July 10, 2024):

- head for age boys z-score [-14, 18]
- head for age girls z-score [-25, 17,8]
- length for age boys z-score [-24, 8,7]
- length for age girl z-score [-17, 7,3]
- weight for age boys z-score [-5, 19]
- weight for age girls z-score [-4, 5]
- weight for length boys z-score [17,20] 
- weight for length girl z-score [0, 19]

The validation ranges added were quite wide and still allow for some extreme values at some ages (since the validation needed to apply across all ages for the instrument). Nonetheless, some of the values observed are outside of these ranges, and these should have been filtered out. These extreme values lead to the out of range Z-scores observed above.

**Current validation ranges for these fields are:**     
**Length**: Should be between 30 and 130 cms        
**Head Circumference**: Should be between 25 and 55 cms     
**Weight**: Should be between 0.5 and 30 Kgs        

Based on the current validation ranges and depending on sex and age, we could see Z-scores in the following range:      
**Length**: Approximately -8 to 40      
**Head Circumference**: Approximately -6 to 16      
**Weight**: Approximately -6 to 18      

These extreme values should have been filtered out for BR14. We are currently checking to see why this occurred, and other cases may need to be reviewed as they may appear within the range set, but still be out of the expected range for the age and sex. It is suspected that a lot of cases could be an issue of unit conversion.

### ⚠️ #2 - Misalignment Between Fields in TSV and JSON sidecar
Many fields that are in the TSVs don't align properly to the JSON sidecar, which leads to data being empty in the output. Errors with `run-id` are also present, however this is less important to have because these are parsed in a similar manner as participant and session.
