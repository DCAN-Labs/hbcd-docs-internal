# Version: BR14.5
<p style="font-size: 1.1em">Release date: February 20th, 2025</p>

## Known Issues
### ⚠️ #1 - Missing Labels For 'Levels' On Multi-Select To Checkbox Items
This is due to an adjustment done to multi-select fields, whereby fields with multi-select options are converted into separate columns/fields as 'checkboxes'. In these cases, the values for the checkbox 'levels' is missing, and only the expected labels (TRUE/FALSE) are available in the DD. This is to be resolved for the upcoming BR14.6.

Impacted instruments/fields:

* Multilingual Language Development Screener (ncl_ch_mlds)
* Infant Sensor Questionnaire 1 (nt_ch_sens__qtn_1)  
* Infant Sensor Questionnaire 2 (nt_ch_sens__qtn_2)  
* Infant Sensor Questionnaire 3 (nt_ch_sens__qtn_3)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Chroncond (pex_bm_health_preg__chroncond)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Erhosp (pex_bm_health_preg__erhosp)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Exp I Vacc (pex_bm_health_preg__exp__vacc)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Healthhx (pex_bm_health_preg__healthhx)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Illness (pex_bm_health_preg__illness)  
* Pex Bm Healthv2 Inf (pex_bm_healthv2_inf)  
* Pex Bm Healthv2 Pregg (pex_bm_healthv2_preg)  
* Height/Weight/Head Circumference (ph_ch_anthro)  
* Basic Demographics (sed_basic_demographics)  
* BFY - Benefits/Services, Economic Stress (sed_bm_bfy)  
* Demographics (sed_bm_demo)  
* Demographics (sed_bm_phx__discr)  

### ⚠️ #2 - Missing Labels/Description For All Instruments
To make the DD BIDS compliant, the change in the name of the DD metadata for the field description was changed from 'label' to 'Description' and the 'unit' to 'Units'. This change was not initially recognized by Lasso, so the description for fields were missing for all instrument. As a result, Lasso is now aware and looking to resolve this issue for the upcoming BR14.6.

### ⚠️ #3 - `pex_bm_health_preg` Leaked HTML Code
The field `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__02` has HTML leak text in the output: `<span style="color:#888;">[<span style="margin:0 2px;">No results were returned</span>]</span>`. This has been resolved for BR14.6.

### ⚠️ #4 - `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__01` Medication Code Entries Replaced With GUID (Bug In De-Identitification Worfklow)
The field `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__01` has 3 entries that start with sub-XXXXXX instead of medication codes. Per Santiago, these entries are the GUID used to de-identify the data. This is due to the de-identification process, which recognizes the code for the medication as if it were a 'candID' and replaces it with the GUID (in this case the following codes were replaced with the corresponding GUID: 211965, 372596, 998033). 

This is something that should be addressed on the next de-identification process. Harshitha is aware and will modify the de-identification process to run solely on the identifier columns (candID) and not on the data, as 6 digit numbers may be mistaken for IDs and replaced with GUIDs. This should be resolved for the upcoming BR14.6. 

In addition, 5 entries that were incorrectly entered as strings instead of codes for this field were caught and replaced.

### ⚠️ #5 - Codes inserted as labels for 2 instances in `pex_bm_health_preg__illness`
