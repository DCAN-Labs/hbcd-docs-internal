# Version: BR14.7
<p style="font-size: 1.1em">Release date: TBD</p>

The BR14.7 iteration of the Data Release data dump has been completed. Data was pushed to the same S3 bucket as the 1st iteration:  
s3fs#hbcd-main-staging 	/loris/loris_server/volumes/data/loris/data/stg_s3_data/  

The following have been implemented in this release:  

## Features/General

* Parquet files generated for MRI & EEG  
* Parquet files generated for Shadow Matrices for MRI & EEG (Pending for BHV)  
* Ensured 'Visit Data' includes all listed participants and events (visits/sessions)  

## MRI/EEG/BioSensors
**MRI:**

  * Added Shadow Matrix files for MRI & EEG derivatives  
  * New QSIPREP values included  
  * Correction of QSIPREP data dictionary (Replaced 'string' with 'text')  
  * Ensured all blank fields have a values in the Shadow Matrix  
  * Set to “Missing - Reason Unknown” for fields with no established reason for a field being blank  
  * Fixed missing run_id in shadow matrices MRI & EEG files  

**EEG:** Removal of columns in MADE EEG spreadsheets (Depending on task)  

**BrainSwipes:** BrainSwipes generation is skipped (Not yet ready)

**BioSpecimens:** Added more clear descriptions for 'Nail weight' fields  

## Basic Demographics 

* Child race/ethnicity fields set to 'Unknown' at V01  
* Mother ACS and 'Age at delivery' values provided at V01  

## Data Dictionary
* Added Keys & Values to 'Child Race' and 'Child Ethnicity' fields (previously had no 'value' for 'levels')  
* Updated DD elements for selected categorical fields  
* Remove newly identified 'Descriptive' fields  
* Updated DD elements for GAA & ACAA fields  
    * 'type_var': Set to 'administrative'  
    * 'type_data': Set to 'integer'  
    * 'type_level': Set to 'ratio'  
* Added 'levels' for 'Project', 'Cohort' and 'Site'  
    * 'type_data' set to 'character'  
* Updated 'type_var', 'type_data', 'type_level' and 'type_field' DD element designations for flagged fields  

## Database/Scoring  
* Included 'Date of Administration' for all instruments  
* Added 'Gestational Age' and 'Candidate Age' for BioSpecimens, MRI & EEG  
* Gestational age adjusted to be calculated based on LMP (EDC+280 days) and reported in weeks (rounded down)  
* Removed duplicate instrument name (pex_ch_tlfb) from fieldnames  
* **Pending:** Remove 'Pex Medication' incongruent Start & End dates entered for 5 cases  

## Filters  
**Fields added:** BioSpecimens > Candidate age (based on 'Collection date')         
**Fields excluded:** Excluded TLFB 'self_report_alcohol_v1' field       
**Removed 'Descriptive' fields** - Not used for data entry (n=73)

## Counts

* Total number of participants queried from DB: 1,441  
* Total number of visits  
    * All: 2,228  
        * V01: 1,441  
        * V02: 675  
        * V03: 122  
* By Sex:  
    * Unknown (Only V01): 769  
    * Female: 329  
    * Male: 343

## BR14.7 Resolved Known Issues

### ⚠️ Incompatible Format of M-CRIB-S and FreeSurfer Data
**Details**: M-CRIB-S and FreeSurfer do not follow the BIDS subdirectory convention of other derivatives, using `sub-<label>_ses-<label>` instead of `sub-<label>/ses-<label>`. As a result, import failed because we cannot extract the subject/session. The data was reorganized in the prerelease bucket to follow the BIDS convention for folder substructure and we contacted the developers to add a flag to Nibabies to output these folders in this structure.      

### ⚠️ Missing Administrative Variables (Gestational and Candidate Age) for BioSpecimen, MRI/EEG & Derived categories

### ⚠️ Gestational Age Erroneously Includes Negative Values
Gestational age should be based on the LMP (EDD+280 days) and therefore none of the values should be negative.

### ⚠️ Biospecimen Data: 2 Fields for Nail Weight Available   
Two fields exist for ‘nail weight’ for the biospecimens data. LORIS and the WG are looking into these and will make a decision as to which one to keep, or keep both (but explain in detail the difference between the 2 reported nail weights).

### ⚠️ BrainSwipes Erroneously Included        
**Details**: BrainSwipes should have not been included, and this was an oversight on removing the files generated from the S3 bucket before de-identification. The BrainSwipes data is not ready for release and should not be considered yet.
