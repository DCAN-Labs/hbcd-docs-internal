## Updates Expected

The below listed changes to the data tables (`.tsv`) are expected. The accompanying `.json` file for each instrument contains the Data Dictionary elements describing the instrument fields for the given instrument. Below is the list of the changes expected.

## List of instruments modified

* Basic Demographics (`sed_bm_demographics`)  
* Visit Data (`par_visit_data`)  
* Demographics Screener (`adm_bm_screen`)  
* REDCap Demographics (`sed_bm_demo`)  
* BioSpecimens Urine Results (`bio_bm_biosample_urine`)  
* Pex Health Meds (`pex_bm_health_preg_i_meds`)  
* TLFB (`pex_bm_tlfb`)

* SPM-2 Infant (`ncl_cg_spm2_i_inf`)  
* SPM-2 Toddler (`ncl_cg_spm2_i_tod`)  
* EPDS (`pex_bm_epds`)

## Basic Demographics

The `sed_basic_demographics` files contain ‘Demographics’ data of general interest within the phenotype context. Expected changes include:

* Changed Shadow Matrix note for GAD/MAD to 'Child's DoB not reported or available for participant'  
* Checked scoring for ACS EthnoRacial fields  
    * `ethnoracial_acs_by_multi_ethnicity`  
    * `ethnoracial_acs_by_multi_race`  
* Added option 7 (Other) for ‘AOU Race/Ethnicity’  
* Fixed derived ‘Income’ variable not available for all participants (`sed_bm_demo_002`)

## Visit Data

The `par_visit_data` files contain all participant visit data. This includes:

* Added BioSpecimen SU flags to the SU flags in the 'Visit Data' (alcohol, opioid, cannabis, and nicotine)  
* Filtered GAD/MAD cases where no V02/V03 was available for participant

## Demographics Screener (`adm_bm_screener`)

Regarding `adm_bm_screener` files:

* Removed 'Hawaiian' option from race field in 'Demographics Screener'  
* Corrected ‘Ethnicity’ output options (4 options for dichotomous field)  
* Corrected ‘Mother Race’ options (Black or African American option listed twice)

## BioSpecimens - Urine Toxicology Results

Regarding `bio_bm_biosample_urine` files:

* Corrected values for the 'Urine Specific Gravity' field  
    * `bio_bm_biosample_urine_bio_spg_u` incorrectly set to '1'   
* Corrected values for the 'Nail Weight' field  
    * `bio_bm_biosample_nails_results_bio_nail_weight` incorrectly set to 'integer'   
* Changed 'integer' to 'double'   
    * 'Nail Weight' field (`bio_bm_biosample_nails_results_bio_nail_weight`)  
* Set all negative values to '0' for `bio_bm_biosample_urine_bio_c_cot_u` 
* Dates included  
    * Collection  
    * Received  
    * Report  
* Converted timestamps to dates  
* Corrected V01 entries with negative gestational ages (n=2)  
* Ensured no values reported for 'Gestational age' for V02 or 'Candidate Age' for V01

## TLFB

Regarding `pex_bm_tlfb` files:  

* SU Flags based on cumulative scores across V01 & V02

## APA

Regarding `pex_bm_apa` files:

* Revamped scoring algorithm

## SPM-2

Regarding `ncl_cg_spm2_i_inf` files:

* Revamped scoring algorithm

## Pex Health Meds/Pex Health V2 Inf

Regarding `pex_bm_health_preg_i_meds` and `pex_bm_healthv2_inf` files: 

* Added labels for ICD code names
