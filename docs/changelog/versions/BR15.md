<p style="font-size: 1.1em">Release date: TBD</p>

## Features/General

* Parquet files for the BHV Shadow Matrices generated  
* BrainSwipes data included
* Set blank entries in tsv files to 'Null' in the corresponding Parquet files for all BHV and BioSpecimen files
* Removed gender and sex related fields for REDCap Demographics (`sed_bm_demo`)

## MRI/EEG/BioSensors

#### MRI/EEG
Changed label for 'Gestational age' in scans/sessions.tsv from 'age_gestational' to 'age_adjusted' 

#### BrainSwipes
* Updated and revised feedback data included  
* Filtered non valid sessions from BrainSwipes  
* Adjusted 'run_id' format to '01', '02', ... in parquet files to align with tsv files (BrainSwipes re-run)

#### BioSpecimens
* Added 'bm' (Birth Mother) as 'source' to all BioSpecimen fields  
* Removed invalid sessions from BioSpecimen files  
* Transformed '-999' code to corresponding note ("Please refer to corresponding categorical field for more details") in Shadow Matrix  
* Removed 'Nail Weight' field from 'Nail Type' file (Messy and not consistent in format)  
* Removed 'nail_type' in the 'bio_biosample_nails_results' (Redundant and did not provide any info)  
* Removed 'visit_timepoint' fields as levels did not align with input in fields  
* Removed text from 'nail weight' and push units (mg) to 'units' metadata  
* Changed data type for timestamps fields (BioSpecimens)  
* Changed incorrect metadata entry on Data Dictionary for 'Urine' field 'bio_c_crs_u_cat'  

## Basic Demographics 
Forced insert for visit missing on 'Basic Demographics' (`sed_basic_demographics`)  

## Data Dictionary
* Checked 'Integer' with decimal values. Converted to 'double' where necessary  
* Changed 'type_data' for TLFB fields from 'text' to 'numeric'  
* Changed 'type_var' for selected BrainSwipes from 'count' to 'administrative'  
* Changed 'type_data' for selected BrainSwipes from 'float' to 'double'  
* Set 'type_level' for selected BioSpecimen (n=5), Basic Demographics (n=3) and Visit Data (n=17) fields  
* Reviewed and adapted invalid dates: Changed format to align with expected format, including for timestamp fields  
* Changed date to timestamp in data_type metafield (end format = YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss) for biospecimen.
* Removed BrainSwipes `collection_platform` and `loris_required` metadata fields.

## Shadow Matrices
* Added note to Shadow Matrices for GAA blanks at V02/V03  
* Pushed note on 'Height/Weight/Head Circumference to Shadow Matrix  
* Pushed note on '-999' code for BioSpecimens to Shadow Matrix  

## Database/Scoring:  
* SU flags on TLFB based on TRUE/FALSE (instead of Yes/No)  
* Adjustments made to GAA (Gestational Age at Administration) for BioSpecimens and BHV tables  
* Update 'PTSD/Acute Stress' scoring to include prorated scoring scheme  
* Removed duplicate instrument name in fieldname (foodins_category)  
* Removed score fields and restored values for 'SPM-2'
* Changed invalid date entry on one date:`2023-0915` to `2023-09-15`

## Filters  
* Removed 'nail_weight', 'nail_type' and 'visit_timepoint' fields from BioSpecimen fields (see above)  
* Removed score fields for 'SPM-2'  
* Removed gender and sex related fields for REDCap Demographics (`sed_bm_demo`)
* Excluded Z-score fields for 'Height/Weight/Head Circumference' (`ph_ch_anthro`)

## Counts

* Total number of participants queried from DB: 1,426  
* Total number of visits  
    * All: 2,207  
        * V01: 1,426  
        * V02: 660  
        * V03: 121  
* By Sex (V02/V03 visit done):  
    * Female: 328  
    * Male: 338

## BR15 Resolved Known Issues

### ⚠️ BioSpecimens: Transform '-999' 
The -999 code needed to be transformed to a note in shadow matrices. Relevant shadow matrices include: `bio_biosample_nails_results`, `bio_biosample_nails_type`, and `bio_biosample_urine`.

### ⚠️ Duplicate Rows for BioSpecimens
Flagged cases had two visits (V01 & V02). Flagged duplicates labeled as 'ses-V02'. Team verified with MSI on de-identified files to confirm if both visits are incorrectly labeled as 'ses-V02' during de-identification.

### ⚠️ Height/Weight/Head Circumference missing 'Date of Administration' (~6 cases)
