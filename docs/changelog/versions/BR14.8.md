    * `bio_biosample_nails_results`  
    * `bio_biosample_nails_type`  
    * `bio_biosample_urine`

## Basic Demographics / Visit Data (sed_basic_demographics) / par_visit_data)

* Duplicate rows for visits V02 and V03 on Basic Demographics removed  
* Implemented multiple columns for multi-select options (`rc_mother_race_multi`; `screen_race_multi`)  
* Added Levels for Child Race & Child Ethnicity  
* Visit missing for Visit Data included  
* Removed duplicates for Shadow Matrix for the Visit Data (`par_visit_data`)  
* Pushed `No candidate age at V01` note to Shadow Matrices  

## Data Dictionary
* Made keys/values consistently displayed across all tsv tables  
* Updated DD elements for selected 'character' fields  
* Removed newly identified 'descriptive' fields  
* Pushed 'No candidate age at V01' note to Shadow Matrices  
* Ensured all 'Adjusted Chronological Age' fields are set to 'type_data' = 'integer'  
* Updated 'type_var', 'type_data', 'type_level' and 'type_field' DD element designations for flagged 'categorical' fields (as per feedback)  
* Integers no longer converted to decimal format (MSI addressed for de-identification process)  

## Database/Scoring  
* Removed selected APA score fields  
* Removed all 'roster' fields from `sed_bm_demo`  
* Fixed issue with parsing of TLFB values for Wk-01 & Wk-02  
* Addressed issue excluding data for the 'Height/Weight/Head Circumference' (`ph_ch_anthro`)  

## Age Fields
* Ensured GAA only available at V01 (not available at V02 onwards)  
* Ensured ACAA only available at V02 onwards (not available at V01)  

## Filters  
*No updates made to filters.*

## BR14.8 Resolved Known Issues

### ⚠️ Duplicated Rows in Basic Demographics
The number of rows/sessions included in Basic Demographics (`sed_basic_demographics`) are duplicated, which increases the number of reported V02 and V03 sessions in the Basic Demographics. The data can still be consistently queried by using the first entry for a given participant, so the only issue is that the number of sessions should not be tallied from this table. 

### ⚠️ Missing `par-visit-dat` File (sub-858XXXXXXX)
This participant is absent from the database (DW queries), but is present in phenotype files. Lasso needs the proper entry to be added in par-visit-data.tsv. This was hacked by the Lasso team to not block ingestion, but in a real scenario, ingestion would not be possible.

### ⚠️ Biospecimen Data: Missing Shadow Matrix
Shadow matrix is not currently available for biospecimen data. LORIS will populate the shadow matrix with a place holder for the next release and work with the WG to discern reasons for missingness. The target release for fix is TBD until the reason for missingness is assessed. For  BR14.7, placeholder text will be added to populate the shadow matrix.
