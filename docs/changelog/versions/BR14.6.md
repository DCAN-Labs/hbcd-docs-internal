## BR14.6 Resolved Known Issues
### ⚠️ `pex_bm_health_preg` Leaked HTML Code
The field `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__02` has HTML leak text in the output: `<span style="color:#888;">[<span style="margin:0 2px;">No results were returned</span>]</span>`. 

### ⚠️ `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__01` Medication Code Entries Replaced With GUID (Bug In De-Identitification Worfklow)
The field `pex_bm_health_preg__meds_003__01` has 3 entries that start with sub-XXXXXX instead of medication codes. Per Santiago, these entries are the GUID used to de-identify the data. This is due to the de-identification process, which recognizes the code for the medication as if it were a 'candID' and replaces it with the GUID (in this case the following codes were replaced with the corresponding GUID: 211965, 372596, 998033). 

This is something that should be addressed on the next de-identification process. Harshitha is aware and will modify the de-identification process to run solely on the identifier columns (candID) and not on the data, as 6 digit numbers may be mistaken for IDs and replaced with GUIDs. 

In addition, 5 entries that were incorrectly entered as strings instead of codes for this field were caught and replaced.

### ⚠️ Codes inserted as labels for 2 instances in `pex_bm_health_preg__illness`

### ⚠️ Deleted EEG Data Causing 404 Errors
The V03 acquisitions for 5 participants errored in MADE and had various issues, therefore the EEG Workgroup asked for those files to be removed from the release. However, the EEG files were removed from BR14 and BR14.5 post-ingestion, which lead to 404 file not found errors when users queried file-based data in BR14. Reloading BR14.5 has removed the indexes and resolved this issue (i.e. these missing files are no longer queriable via Lasso). There are still some EEG files available for those participants, but only files of format TSV and JSON for the channels and no main SET or EDF files. 

### ⚠️ Globus Defaults to User's Home Directory on Windows
For Mac users, Globus displays all the directories available on their system, but for Windows, it defaults to the path to the user's home directory. This is a known bug. Robust error handling will be added to handle paths that either Globus Connect doesn't have access to or paths that don't exist in the user's file system.

### ⚠️ Missing Labels For 'Levels' On Multi-Select To Checkbox Items
This is due to an adjustment done to multi-select fields, whereby fields with multi-select options are converted into separate columns/fields as 'checkboxes'. In these cases, the values for the checkbox 'levels' is missing, and only the expected labels (TRUE/FALSE) are available in the DD. 

Impacted instruments/fields:

* Multilingual Language Development Screener (ncl_ch_mlds)
* Infant Sensor Questionnaire 1 (nt_ch_sens__qtn_1)  
* Infant Sensor Questionnaire 2 (nt_ch_sens__qtn_2)  
* Infant Sensor Questionnaire 3 (nt_ch_sens__qtn_3)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Chroncond (pex_bm_health_preg__chroncond)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Erhosp (pex_bm_health_preg__erhosp)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Exp I Vacc (pex_bm_health_preg__exp__vacc)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Healthhx (pex_bm_health_preg__healthhx)  
* Pex Bm Health Preg I Illness (pex_bm_health_preg__illness)  
* Pex Bm Healthv2 Inf (pex_bm_healthv2_inf)  
* Pex Bm Healthv2 Pregg (pex_bm_healthv2_preg)  
* Height/Weight/Head Circumference (ph_ch_anthro)  
* Basic Demographics (sed_basic_demographics)  
* BFY - Benefits/Services, Economic Stress (sed_bm_bfy)  
* Demographics (sed_bm_demo)  
* Demographics (sed_bm_phx__discr)  

### ⚠️ Missing Labels/Description For All Instruments
To make the DD BIDS compliant, the change in the name of the DD metadata for the field description was changed from 'label' to 'Description' and the 'unit' to 'Units'. This change was not initially recognized by Lasso, causing the description for fields to be missing for all instruments. 

### ⚠️ Empty Label Column in HBCD Data Dictionary
The field dictionary "label" has been renamed "Description," diverging from ABCD convention. To fix this, Lasso will change the UI to read “DESCRIPTION” (instead of label); so wherever the user goes they will see the same thing (JSON or DD). Lasso will populate DESCRIPTION with DESCRIPTION in the JSON from HBCD (Lasso used to look for “LABEL” in the JSON, which is no longer present). For ABCD: “‘label” in their data dictionary csv will populate the DESCRIPTION column in the DD. 

### ⚠️ Issue With `nibabies.toml` Files
Lasso bug: FE import with duplicated ID impacting the Nibabies file type `bids/derivatives/nibabies/sub-<label>/ses-<label>/log/20250125-071817_f14585f4-03b1-48ef-8cdc-edc3eb0be744/nibabies.toml`.
