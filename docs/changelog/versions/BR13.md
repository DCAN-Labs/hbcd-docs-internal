# Version: BR13
<p style="font-size: 1.1em">Release date: January 24, 2025</p>

## Updates & Corrections

### ⚠️ #1 - BR13 Lasso Import Blocked
BR13 is currently blocked for Lasso because BR13 renamed `participant_id` and `session_id` by prepending `table_name_participant_id`. As a result, the `participant_id` and `session_id` is different across all tables.

### ⚠️ #2 - TLFB 'user_completion' Field Not Excluded
In addition, 'user_completion' in TLFB (precise name: 'ph_ch_tlfb_tlfb_user_completion') was originally reported to have been removed under [Fields Excluded](#fields-excluded), but it was noticed that BR14 still contained this field. This will be resolved for BR15.

## Features/General

* Shadow Matrix generated for Demographics, Visit Data and BHV (Instrument data)  
    * Missed VisitMissed Instrument  
    * Decline to Answer / Don't Know  
    * Skipped due to logic  
    * Missed Unknown  
* Parquet files to be generated for all instruments and will be sent directly to Janosch (to be incorporated fully in BR14)

## MRI/EEG/BioSensors

* MRI:  
    * Added GAB & Candidate Age for Imaging tabular data  
    * Continuous and discrete set to 'interval' for 'type_level'  
* BioSensors:  
    * File Based data included (.cwa BIDS Raw)

## BioSpecimen toxicology results
* Removed 'unit' columns from data file  
* Incorporated 'unit' information into 'unit' DD element for corresponding fields in metadata  
    * All 'domain' entries for BioSpecimens use 'BioSpecimens' (instead of 'Biospecimens')  
    * 'Categorical' used for 'type_level' for BioSpecimens (as per DD provided)  

## Basic Demographics (sed_basic_demographics)

#### Removed 'substance_use' and 'rc_mother_language' fields from 'Basic Demographics'  

#### Global 'Basic Demographics' variables 
* GAD - Gestational Age at Delivery (*gestational_age_delivery*):  
    * Based on: Difference between child's DOB and mother's LMP  
    * Expressed in: weeks  
    * Rounding: Weeks  
* MAV01 - Maternal Age at V01 (*mother_age_v01*):  
    * Based on: Mother's age based on mother's DoB to V01 visit date  
    * Expressed in: Years with two decimal precision  
    * Rounding: Fractional years are expressed as floored months / 12  
* MAD - Maternal Age at Delivery (*mother_age_delivery*):  
    * Based on: Mother's age based on mother's DoB to DoB of the child  
    * Expressed in: Years with two decimal precision  
    * Rounding: Fractional years are expressed as floored months / 12  
    
#### Instrument specific variables: 
  * GAA - Gestational Age at Administration (*instrumentName_gestational_age*):  
    * Based on: LMP to 'Date of Administration' for a given instrument (previously based on EDD/EDC, added 280 days to base it on LMP).  
    * Expressed in: 'Days' (To be changed to weeks for BR14)  
    * Rounding: None  

## Data Dictionary

* **Column headers:** Column headers now include 'instrument name' concatenated with 'fieldname' (for all instruments and derived categories)
* **'label'/'unit':** Changed 'label' to 'Description' and 'unit' to 'Units'  
* **‘table_label’:** Inserted as the 'Description' at the top of the DD (MeasurementToolMetadata)  
* Removed selected unnecessary DD elements:  
    * LongName  
    * question  
    * data_scope  
    * coding_format  
    * description_status  
    * redcap_required  
    * loris_required  
    * redcap_text_validation_type  
    * redcap_text_validation_min  
    * redcap_text_validation_max  
    * redcap_identifier  
    * redcap_custom_alignment  
    * redcap_question_number  
    * redcap_matrix_group_name  
    * redcap_matrix_ranking  
    * redcap_field_annotation  
* **order_sort:** index created for all instrument tables. '0' for paticipant_id, then increasing in order of column headers of .tsv table  
* **'type_field'**: 'text' / string converted to 'numeric' (some exceptions pending to be addressed)  
* **'type_level':** Nominal and Ordinal set to 'type_data' = 'character' (Fields with 'type_level' Nominal or Ordinal (Categorical fields) set to 'character' for 'type_data')  
* **'type_level':** 'continuous' and 'discrete' set to 'interval'  

## Database/Scoring 
* Addressed Multiple rows per participant being generated in some instrument .tsv tables  
* 'Administration' reported as 'n/a' now contains value instead of 'n/a'  

## Label Adjustments
* MAPS-TL & ecPROMIS: Relabel 'Prorated scores' to 'Total score' (changed from integer to double) and removed old 'Total Score'  
  
## Filters  
* Forced insertion/exclusion of participants: Pending participants with a V01 visit included/excluded as per site updated ('LaunchPad Complete' after July 1, 2024 exceptions granted)  

## Fields excluded  
  * Excluded APA fields with duplicate values (2_depr_001_i_01 to 2_depr_008_i_01)
